# CodeCumbria Crawler

## A game for Code Cumbria #12 - Wednesday 24th April 2013
(Based upon http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod)

I say a game..... Well, not a complete one at any rate.


**Note:** The included library files have been compiled for a 32-bit Linux system. If you want to have a play with the code, you will need a version of libtcod for your system of choice.

Sources and binaries are available at http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

The website also features osme games built using the library, and various tutorials, documentation etc.
